# BLAST-SENSOR-graphs
Creation of three plots with a few of BLAST MOTION's metrics

This script makes three plots with a few metrics from a blast motion baseball sensor. *There is no ball flight metrics included in this data.*


The first plot is a density plot showing attack angles on a tee and off live bp/machinea(also printed on the graph is the average respective attack angles that wer calculated from the data.
The second and third plots are correlation matrices to analyse the relationship between the tee and live metrics pulled.


*I imported two csv files, one was all of the balls hit off the tee by the user and the other is all of the live bp/machine balls hit by the user*
